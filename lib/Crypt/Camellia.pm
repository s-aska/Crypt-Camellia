=head1 NAME

Crypt::Camellia - Perl Camellia encryption module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Crypt::Camellia;
  my $cipher     = Crypt::Camellia->new($key); 
  my $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext);
  my $plaintext  = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

  # more likely
  use Crypt::CBC;
  $cipher = Crypt::CBC->new( -key    => 'my secret key',
                             -cipher => 'Camellia'
                            );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements Camelia 128-bit Block Cipher for perl.
For Camellia.  Check L<https://info.isl.ntt.co.jp/crypt/eng/camellia/index_s.html>.  Here is an exerpt of that page.

=over 2

Camellia is a symmetric key block cipher developed jointly in 2000 by
world top class encryption researchers at NTT and Mitsubishi Electric
Corporation. Technologically speaking, Camellia naturally has not only
a high level of security, but also excellent efficiency and practical
characteristics. It can be implemented at high performance by software
on various platforms. In regard to hardware implementation, compact
and low-power consumption type implementation as well as high-speed
implementation is possible.

Based on these technological advantages, Camellia has been
internationally recognized, for example the selection project on the
European recommendation of strong cryptographic primitives, NESSIE,
evaluated Camellia to have "many similarities to the AES, so much of
the analysis for the AES is also applicable to Camellia." Currently,
Camellia is the only cipher internationally recognized which has the
same level of security and performance as AES, and is selected for
many international standard/recommended ciphers. In particular, as
Japanese domestic ciphers, this is the first case to be approved as
IETF standard ciphers (Proposed Standard RFC) .

=back

Crypt::Camellia has the following methods:

=over 2

 blocksize()
 keysize()
 encrypt()
 decrypt()

=back

Like many Crypt:: modules like L<Crypt::Blowfish> and L<Crypt::DES>,
this module works as a backend of L<Crypt::CBC>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 2

=item blocksize

Returns the size (in bytes) of the block cipher.  Currently this is a
fixed value of 16.

=item new

  my $cipher = Crypt::Camellia-E<gt>new($key);

This creates a new Crypt::Camellia BlockCipher object, using $key,
where $key is a key of C<keysize()> bytes (minimum of eight bytes).

=item encrypt

  my $ciphertext = $cipher-E<gt>encrypt($plaintext);

This function encrypts $plaintext and returns the $ciphertext
where $plaintext and $ciphertext must be of C<blocksize()> bytes.
(hint:  Camellia is an 16 byte block cipher)

=item decrypt

  my $plaintext = $cipher-E<gt>decrypt($ciphertext);

This function decrypts $ciphertext and returns the $plaintext
where $plaintext and $ciphertext must be of C<blocksize()> bytes.
(hint:  see previous hint)

=back

=head1 EXAMPLE

  my $key = pack("H16", "0123456789ABCDEF");  # min. 8 bytes
  my $cipher = Crypt::Camellia->new($key);
  my $ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt("plaintex");# SEE NOTES 
  print unpack("H16", $ciphertext), "\n";

=head1 NOTES

For practical uses use this module via L<Crypt::CBC> rather than directly. 

=head1 SEE ALSO
